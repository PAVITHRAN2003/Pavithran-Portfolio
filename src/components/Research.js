    title: "Self-Supervised Learning for Cross-Domain Brain Disease Classification",
    conference: "IEEE CogMI 2025 â€“ Paper 7461",
    description: `Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's Disease, brain tumors, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis pose growing challenges globally. 
To address the scarcity of annotated medical data, I collaborated on developing an end-to-end self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MRI representation and low-label classification of brain diseases. 
We pre-trained encoders using SimCLR, MoCo v3, and BYOL on unlabeled brain MRI slices from the OASIS dataset, and fine-tuned the models using only 450 labeled images per class to classify Alzheimer's into four stages: Non-Demented, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia. 
The framework was further extended to cross-domain brain disease classification, achieving over 90% test accuracy for tumors, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis. 
Grad-CAM was used for interpretable visualizations, with explainability metrics including Activation Intensity, Area Percentage, and Class Confidence. 
The full system was deployed via a lightweight Flask web app, delivering real-time predictions and interpretability outputs. This work demonstrates SSL as a practical, scalable, and explainable solution for medical imaging.`
