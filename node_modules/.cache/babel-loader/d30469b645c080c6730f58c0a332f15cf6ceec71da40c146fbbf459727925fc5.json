Leveraging mixed precision training in PyTorch, I reduced memory consumption and convergence time by 35%. Built a FastAPI backend that supports over 100 concurrent requests with latency under 200ms, enabling fast, scalable summarization for real-world applications.\"},{title:\"Pintos Operating System Project\",role:\"Team Member | Buffalo, New York | Feb 2025 – May 2025\",description:\"Contributed to building a fully functional Pintos OS in C, optimizing syscall handling, interrupt response, and thread scheduling. Implemented priority donation and advanced syscall mechanisms, passing 90% of key scheduling tests. Debugged complex race conditions using GDB, improving the scheduler's reliability and performance by 15%, demonstrating strong systems programming and problem-solving skills.\"},{title:\"Comprehensive Automotive Database for Enhanced Analytics\",role:\"Team Member | Buffalo, New York | Feb 2025 – Apr 2025\",description:\"Designed a robust PostgreSQL schema and ingestion pipeline for managing over 5,000 automotive records, coupled with a Streamlit frontend for interactive analytics. Automated telemetry, logging, and CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions, cutting operational costs by 60% while creating a maintainable and scalable data platform for automotive analytics.\"},{title:\"Self-Supervised Learning for Cross-Domain Classification (IEEE CogMI 2025 – Paper 7461)\",role:\"Team Member | Buffalo, New York | Feb 2025 – May 2025\",description:\"Implemented self-supervised learning frameworks like SimCLR, BYOL, and MoCo v3 to classify cross-domain brain disease datasets, achieving 96% accuracy. Optimized GPU training with nonlinear batching and augmented pipelines, reducing runtime by 40%, demonstrating the ability to merge cutting-edge ML research with practical performance optimization.\"},{title:\"Noetica Studio - Web-based Image Editor\",role:\"Individual Project | Web-based | HTML5 Canvas & Vanilla JS\",description:\"Built a lightweight, browser-based image editor offering real-time adjustments for exposure, brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness. Added creative filters including Sepia, Vintage, Invert, and Blur, with interactive crop and rotate tools. Designed a high-performance, non-destructive rendering pipeline and flexible export options (PNG, JPEG, WebP), showcasing strong front-end and client-side graphics skills.\"},{title:\"Reader-Collision Prevention using Reinforcement Learning (Poster Project)\",role:\"Team Project | Buffalo, New York | Jan 2025 – Mar 2025\",description:\"Developed a reinforcement learning solution to prevent RFID reader collisions in dense environments.
